Stage 1: Predictors include home/away, Opponent, Hour, and Day 


This project was inspired by a video by Dataquest, but adapted to the NBA instead of the EPL.

### Data Source / Legal
Initially, I built a Python script to collect NBA schedules using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, which taught me about HTML parsing, rate limiting, and responsible automation. Later, I learned about data-use policies and stopped using live scraping. I now use a local snapshot only and do not redistribute the raw CSV or the scraping script.
