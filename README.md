(WORK IN PROGRESS)
Currently building up the initial model


### Data Source / Legal

Initially, I built a Python script to collect NBA schedules using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, which taught me about HTML parsing, rate limiting, and responsible automation. Later, I learned about data-use policies and stopped using live scraping. I now use a local snapshot only and do not redistribute the raw CSV or the scraping script.
